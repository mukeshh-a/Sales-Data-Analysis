# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-on-Retail-FMCG-dataset


This project was completed using RStudio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R. The goal of this project was to analyze sales data and provide insights and actionable recommendations to optimize the company's product offerings, marketing campaigns, and pricing strategies.

To begin the analysis, the sales data was imported into RStudio in the form of a CSV file. The data was then cleaned and preprocessed using R functions to ensure that the data was in the correct format for analysis.

Once the data was cleaned, various R packages were used to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate visualizations to gain insights into the data. Some of the packages used include ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.

After conducting EDA, various statistical analyses were performed to answer the specific questions posed in the business request. The results of these analyses were then used to generate actionable recommendations to optimize the company's operations.

Finally, the findings and recommendations were presented to the stakeholders using visualizations and reports generated using RMarkdown, a tool for creating dynamic documents with R code and analysis.

Overall, RStudio was an essential tool for conducting this analysis and generating insights and recommendations for the company. By utilizing the power of R and various R packages, we were able to provide data-driven recommendations that can help the company increase sales, customer engagement, and loyalty.
